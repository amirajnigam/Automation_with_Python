1. Strings are enclosed by a pair of single quotes or double quotes (as long as the same kind are used).
2. Escape characters let you put quotes and other characters that are hard to type inside strings.
3. Raw strings (which have the r prefix before the first quote) will literally print any backslashes in the string and ignore escape characters.
4. Multiline strings begin and end with three quotes, and can span multiple lines.
5. Indexes, slices, and the "in" and "not in" operators all work with strings.
