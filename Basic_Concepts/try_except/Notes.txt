1. A diuvide-by-zero error happens when python divides a number by zero
2. Errors cause the program to crash.
3. An error that happens inside a try block will cause code in the except block to execute. That code can handle the error or display a message to the user so that  the program can keep going.



Q. why try and except required, we can use if else to do the same job?
Ans. if we get an  error or exception, the entire program will crash. We don't want this ti happen in real world scenario. Instead we
     want the program to detect the error handle them and then continue to run.
